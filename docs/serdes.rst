Serializtion/Deserilization protocol
====================================

Serializer and Deserializer are used to marshal and unmarshal messages according to a given schema by adding schema version information along with the payload.
There are different protocols in how schema version is passed along with the payload.

Confluent protocol
``````````````````
Protocol-id: 0

Serialization
"""""""""""""
Message format: <version-info><payload>
version-info: version identifier as integer type, so it would be of 4 bytes.

payload:
  if schema type is byte array
    then write byte array as it is.
  else
    follow the below process to serialize the payload.

  if the given payload is of specific-record type
    then use specific datum writer
  else
    use generic datum writer along with binary encoder.

Deserialization
"""""""""""""""
Message format: <version-info><payload>
version-info: version identifier as integer type, so it would be of 4 bytes.

Get the respective avro schema for the given schema version id which will be writer schema.
User Deserializer API can take any schema version which can be treated as reader schema.

  if schema type is byte array
    then read byte array as it is.
  else
    follow the below process to deserialize the payload.

  if the given payload is of specific-record type
    then use specific datum writer
  else
    use generic datum writer along with binary encoder.

  if user api asks to read it as specific-record
    then use specific datum reader
  else
    use generic datum reader passing both writer and reader schemas.

Schema version id as long protocol
``````````````````````````````````
Protocol-id: 2

Serialization
"""""""""""""
Message format: <version-info><payload>
version-info: long value which represents schema version id, viz 8 bytes

payload:
  if schema type is byte array
    then write byte array as it is.
  else
    follow the below process to serialize the payload.

  if the given payload is of specific-record type
    then use specific datum writer
  else
    use generic datum writer along with binary encoder.

Deserialization
"""""""""""""""
Message format: <version-info><payload>
version-info: long value which represents schema version id, viz 8 bytes

Get the respective avro schema for the given schema version id which will be writer schema.
User Deserializer API can take any schema version which can be treated as reader schema.

  if schema type is byte array
    then read byte array as it is
  else if schema type is string
    then generate UTF-8 string from the remaining bytes
  else
    follow the below process to deserialize the payload

  if the given payload is of specific-record type
    then use specific datum writer
  else
    use generic datum writer along with binary encoder.

  if user api asks to read it as specific-record
    then use specific datum reader
  else
    use generic datum reader passing both writer and reader schemas.

Schema version id as int protocol
`````````````````````````````````
Protocol-id: 2

This protocol's serialization and deserialization of payload process is similar to Schema version id as long protocol except the schema version id is treated as int.

Schema metadata id and version protocol
```````````````````````````````````````
Protocol-id: 1

This protocol's serialization and deserialization of payload process is similar to Schema version id as long protocol except the version info contains both schema metadata od and version number.

Message format: <version-info><payload>
version-info: <metadata-id><version>
metadata-id: long value which represents schema metadata id, viz 8 bytes
version: int value of version, viz 4 bytes

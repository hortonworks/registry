#This Cucumber feature testing was deleted when the atlas-plugin was
#  separated and moved from this project, but the test methods and
#  AtlasServer mock were not deleted.
#  We should discuss to delete the test-code or somehow put the
#  atlas plugin here to properly execute these tests.

Feature: Integration with Atlas

#Feature: Integration with Atlas
#
#  Background: Schema Registry is running
#    Given that Atlas is running
#    And Atlas integration is enabled
#    And the model should be created in Atlas
#    And that Schema Registry is running
#
#  Scenario: Create a new schema
#    When we create a new schema meta "Car" with the following parameters:
#    | Name            | Value          |
#    | type            | avro           |
#    | schemaGroup     | Kafka          |
#    | compatibility   | BACKWARD       |
#    | validationLevel | ALL            |
#    | evolve          | true           |
#    | description     | this is a test |
#    Then the schema is successfully created
#    And after waiting for no more than 10 seconds, a request is sent to Atlas to create a new schema "Car"
#
#    When we create a new version for schema "Car" with the following schema:
#    """
#    {
#      "type": "record",
#      "namespace": "com.cloudera",
#      "name": "Car",

#                { "name": "price", "type":  "string", "default": "0" }
#      ]
#    }
#    """
#    Then the version is successfully created
#    And after waiting for no more than 10 seconds, a request is sent to Atlas to create a new version of schema "Car v1"
#
#    When we create a new version for schema "Car" with the following schema:
#    """
#    {

#      ]
#    }
#    """
#    Then the version is successfully created
#    And after waiting for no more than 10 seconds, a request is sent to Atlas to create a new version of schema "Car v2"
#
#
#    When we create a new version for schema "Car" with the following schema:
#    """
#    {
#      "type": "record",
#      "namespace": "com.cloudera",
#      "name": "Car",

#    }
#    """
#    Then the version is successfully created
#    And after waiting for no more than 10 seconds, a request is sent to Atlas to create a new version of schema "Car v3"
#
#
#    When we update the schema "Car" with the following parameters:
#      | Name            | Value     |
#      | Name            | Value     |
#      | type            | avro      |

#      | compatibility   | BACKWARD  |
#      | validationLevel | ALL       |
#      | evolve          | true      |
#      | description     | new value |
#    Then the schema is successfully updated
#    And after waiting for no more than 10 seconds, a request is sent to Atlas to update schema "Car"
#
#    When we check the compatibility of schema "Car" with the following Avro test:
#    """
#    {
#      "type": "record",
#      "namespace": "com.cloudera",
#      "name": "Car",
#      "fields": [ { "name": "model", "type":  "string" } ]
#    }
#    """
#    Then the Avro test is compatible
#
#  Scenario: Creating a schema with a preexisting topic
#    Given there is preexisting "Car2" topic
#    When we create a new schema meta "Car2" with the following parameters:
#      | Name            | Value          |
#      | type            | avro           |

#      | evolve          | true           |
#      | description     | Atlas test     |
#    Then the schema is successfully created
#    And after waiting for no more than 10 seconds, a request is sent to Atlas to create a new schema "Car2"
#    And a new relationship was made in Atlas between the "Car2" schema and the "Car2" topic
#    And no failed Atlas events remain
#
#  Scenario: Creating a schema without an existing topic
#    Given no "Car3" topic exists
#    When we create a new schema meta "Car3" with the following parameters:
#      | Name            | Value          |
#      | type            | avro           |

#      | compatibility   | BACKWARD       |
#      | validationLevel | ALL            |
#      | evolve          | true           |
#      | description     | Atlas test     |
#    Then the schema is successfully created
#    And after waiting for no more than 10 seconds, a request is sent to Atlas to create a new schema "Car3"
#    But no request was made to Atlas to connect the "Car3" schema with any topic
#    And no failed Atlas events remain
